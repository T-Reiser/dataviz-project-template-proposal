# Data Visualization Project Proposal

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the TMDB Top 5000 Movies data set mostly because the dataset contains tons of information that can be visualized in the interactive portion such as movie keywords, genres, taglines and revenue/production cost split and runtime info. This is plenty of information and should lead to some interesting conclusions if visualized nicely. 

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatter plot that shows all 5000 top movies relation between Runtime(X) in minutes and Budget(Y). We see that these movies average a runtime of around 120 minutes. All of the highest budget movies are around the average runtime. No large production studio would finance a really short or long movie, and the highest budget movies are almost exactly two hours. If I could improve this chart, I would work to fix any oclusion that is occuring with dots overlapping each other. This would hopefully provide more information to the viewer.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there any particular Genre that dominates the top 100 or 50 movies, are there any outlier genres in this top section?
 * Is there a corrilation between keywords for a movie, and the budget a movie requires, what keywords occur most often in the top 5000 movies?
 * Which production companies tend to produce the best movies, is there a certain production company that creates a best reutrn on investment?
 * What is the relation between popularity of a movie, and the runtime of the movie, do people really tend to prefer two-ish hour movies?
 * What is the relation between genre and budget these top movies, is there a genre that is cheap to produce and always has a good return on investment?

## Sketches

Here are two sketches that show potential charts that could be made with the choosen dataset. The first shows the Budget($) Vs Revenue($) of the top grossing movies in the dataset. This would allow us to see how much money influneces the revenue a movie makes, and we could also see which movie had the best return on investment.  
The second chart is a scatterplot that shows the Revenue($) Vs Tagline length of a movie. This could provide an interesting result and allow the viewer to see if better performing movies tend to have shorter or longer tagline. We could also improve this data to color it relative to how much certain words or ideas appear in the taglines.
