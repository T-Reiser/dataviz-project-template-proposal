# Data Visualization Project Proposal

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the TMDB Top 5000 Movies data set mostly because the dataset contains tons of information that can be visualized in the interactive portion such as movie keywords, genres, taglines and revenue/production cost split and runtime info. This is plenty of information and should lead to some interesting conclusions if visualized nicely. 

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatter plot that shows all 5000 top movies relation between Runtime(X) in minutes and Budget(Y). We see that these movies average a runtime of around 120 minutes. All of the highest budget movies are around the average runtime. No large production studio would finance a really short or long movie, and the highest budget movies are almost exactly two hours.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
